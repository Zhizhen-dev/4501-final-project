# 4501-final-project

# Description

For many years, uber and yellow taxis have been in a state of competition. However, in March 2022, uber announced cooperation with yellow taxis in New York, which means that New York residences can call yellow taxis through uber. This move is tantamount to making the travel of people more convenient. Looking back on these years, competition and friction are inevitable between Uber and yello taxi since they are in the same industry. This project will analyze the business situation of taxis and uber from 2009 to June 2015, and show their competition.
